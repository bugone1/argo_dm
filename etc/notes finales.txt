2900455 : correction always higher than 1.01; suggests that there was an offset to begin with. There was a drift towards fresher values afterwards, to which I applied a piecewise linear fit.

2900456 : very small correction, do not correct

4900124 : 2 degC level decreases in salinity since profile 65 while mapped salinity is supposed to increase. Even if mapped salinity didn't increase, float salinity would still be too fresh. 
There is a drift towards fresher since profile 65. The drift seems to be on all depth. Ron's previous adjustements seemed not piecewise; redo all of it.
The trend was offset so that profiles don't get "too corrected", in order to agree with profiles from 1 to 22 which seem fine (no offset nor trend).

4900490 : too small. Ron did not correct for [1 50] and the sensor is still below that.

4900491 : Offset towards more saline. Found one problematic position; do not adjust considering the local climatology of that one.
Uncal conductivity at 2ºC is well within climatology during the first 100 cycles, although on the saline side. After 100 cycles the it starts to increase and be slightly more saline. Still too early too say if it is a trend developing.
Do not correct. The 2.4ºC level behaves similarly.

4900492 : very small suggested correction; again, towards more saline. There is however a jump in conductivity between cycles ~93 and ~94 , at 2.2ºC, which is not represented by cliamtology.
At 3.2ºC, which is supposed to reflect water masses and/or eddies, there are a few jumps like that. It would be out of place to apply punctual corrections.
No correction.

4900493 : profile started more saline than normal, now evolves towards fresher. Suggested correction factor remains relatively low (3/1000).
Looking at uncal float at 2ºC, it seems there is a negative drift in conductivity though the climatology is stable. The trend applies to all levels and starts to reach 0.01 psu. 
So we can start correcting now, and to be consequent, extend the trend to all cycles.

4900494 : Atlantic 
seems to be at least an offset towards fresher (~0.015). Is the variation between ~90 and ~145 real or not ? Uncal values at 3.2ºC seem to show that there was indeed a rise in measured salinity during  between cycles, but the climatology seem to show that the uncal values are within climatology.
Almost no valued below 3.2ºC.
3.4ºC level shows that the few jumps in salinity are consistent with region, except for the 90-150 cycles, where the float went in a more saline region. 
My diagnostic is that the salinity is good and stable and the unstable North Atlantic conditions which are reflected in climatology are responsible for the apparent variation.
Should correct for offset but do not correct specifically the 90-145 portion.

4900495 : Atlantic 
salinity at 3.6ºC seems stable, but the reference climatology seems to increase, which is what that drives the correction factor. 
The float probably drifted in a "historically" high salinity region which isn't quite so.
No correction. though there could be an offset towards fresher, it would be a weak one.

4900496 : GOA
Salinity (7ºC) has always been on the low side but it got a lot worse at the last cycles (>66). However, uncal salinity at 2ºC has been quite stable. Diagnostics have been calculated with "high" values of theta.
Apply no correction.

4900499 : GOA
offset towards more saline.. is it plausible ? 2ºC level seems to show slightly more saline than reference in the beginning, but not as of late cycles. Uncal salinty appears stable, it is the climatology which changes.
Do not correct

4900500 : Atlantic
Offset towards fresher ~.01 psu, uncal salinity at 3.4ºC is often below climatology but sometimes right in the middle. It is otherwise stable except for some sudden jumps which are usually well represented by climatology. NO significant trend.
Do not correct

4900501 : Atlantic
Too saline according to graph 4. HOwever, 4.5ºC level shows good salinity in the first 55 profiles; where the software suggests ~1.0004 correction. Jump at 65 seems to be caused by lack of profile data in the deep levels. 
Highest correction factor suggested by graph4 is at cycle 90 but salinity at 4.5ºC shows good agreement at that cycle, though on the low salinity side; 4º is slightly below.
I will correct segment from 63 to end but with an offset of ~1.002 to be continuos with previous, uncorrected segments.

4900502 : Atlantic
Graph 4 suggests a positive correction of ~0.01 psu. The 3.4ºC level shows a stable salinity, no drift. Only climatology changes and still shows good agreement despite being on the low side.
-->Correct by constant 0.01 psu, it will at least bring back one of the salinity values at 3.4ºC in the "middle" of the several mapped salinity ranges.

4900503 : Atlantic
very low correction suggested, but systematic (positive). Uncal salinity at 3.4ºC appears stable and is sometimes "right on".
No correction.

4900504 : Atlantic.
~.01 positive correction suggested with possible trend developing
Salinity at 3.8º seems to show however good salinity with a chnage in the region characteristics well represented in climatologyat profile ~90.
But salinity is almost always on the low side.. could use a push. 
verdict : apply a constant correction of ~0.01 psu 

4900505 : Atlantic
graph 04 shows that the float began its life with fresher than normal salinity but that it resolved gradually to finally be ok at profile 40. This is sort of confirmed by looking at 3.2ºC salinity alone.
Difficult to say since uncal salinity values are unstable at 3.8ºC. Only a few points are available at 3.2 and they seem to suggest slightly too fresh salinities between prof 15 to 40. This could be the end of the gradual resolve.
Correct cycles from 1 to 35 but with an offset of 0.01 psu to make them agree with the following ones.

4900506 : Atlantic / Gulf Stream
salinity at 3.8ºC is very stable and is most times within climatology than not ; when it is not, it is because climatological values increase due to change of climatological regime.
salinity at 3.2ºC is scarce but shows fresher than normal salinty after profile 30. Correction to apply would be small.
Do not adjust.

4900507 : Atlantic / GUlf STream
Small correction suggested [0.015 0.005] psu
However, sal at 3.6ºC agrees quite well towards the end (cycle 100) and even before. It seems we could apply a correction for the very first profiles, with an offset of 0.005 psu
Correction is effected even though small, because it seems to reflect something real : some biocide which leaked when float was deployed and washed away.

4900508 : GOA
graph 4 suggests float started more saline that, and is becoming fresher than. However salinity at 2ºC is stable. The trend is one of climatological values as the float drifts through different water masses at other levels.
Do not correct, but investigate cycle ~45 later, in real-time to see why it is so different at 2ºC
No correction

4900509 : GOA
graph 4 suggests a small but sudden jump at profile ~50. 
There is a salinity value to RTQC at profile ~25, at ~2.6ºC
T=2ºC shows very slow drift in salinity but is rather stable. Perhaps 0.01 psu over 110 cycles.
Do not correct.. trend is very slow.. need more cycles to decide.

4900512 : South Pacific (Chile)
graph4 suggests very small correcion factors | |<0.01
sal at 2.4ºC is stable 
do not correct

4900513 : South Pacific (Chile)
graph4 shows that float seems to start with offset ~0.075 and starts drifting towards fresher value at profile ~90. This is confirmed by 2.2ºC level which shows continuously decreasing salinity.
[34.624 34.612] in ~120 cycles
verdict : apply +.01 slope (psu/cycle) through all profiles ([1 to 1.003 in 120 profiles])

4900514 : GOA
graph4 suggests small correction factors (<.01)
sal at 2ºC seems to indicate slow negative drift; similar to 4900513. 
Drift would be ~([34.54-34.55])/(118-1)
Apply correction as linear fit that reaches ~.01 at 118

4900515 : GOA

graph4 suggests very small offset towards more saline
salinity at 2ºC is stable. 
do not correct

4900519 : GOA 
Float has been drifting from central GOA towards the BC coast. 
Uncal salinity at 2ºC started decreasing on cycle ~100 while climatology suggests it should have increased; and increasing at 3ºC but not "enough" as climatology wants.
There is a gap of deep profiles between ~65 and ~95, so impossible to know what to do there.
Apply a trend starting at 95 and reaching +.01 psu at 141.

4900520 : Pacific
Unstable salinity on all levels including 2ºC; but no apparent trend.
Do not correct

4900521 : GOA/PACIFIC
File has been drifting relatively little. Sal at 2ºC level seems to show two negative trends which are separated by a sudden jump in salinity at profile ~50.
this looks like progressive fouling which suddenly washes off and starts again.
other levels don't show that "jump", they rather show a progressive negative trend.
Climatology doesn't suggests that the salinity is decreasing along path.
Correct with trend based in 2ºC level[34.552 34.536]/[1 120]
[1 1.003]/[1 113]

Do not correct

4900629 : GOA
fig4 suggests a negative correction (-.01) to begin with.
Sal at 2ºC does show higher than climatology salinity which drifts back into normal values by profile ~25.
this would be a [34.35 34.54]/[1 120] slope, a 0.02 psu difference.
There are no physical instrmental reasons to explain a "more saline" bias.
Salinit appears well within norm and stable from 1 to ~50.

4900633 : GOA / Pacific

Graph 4 suggests ~-.015 psu correction!
Salinity at 2ºC seems to show a drift towards negative; though it's been "higher" than climatology in the beginning, the values were ~34.55, which is not uncommon.
It seems that when the float was in the Alaskan Stream, its salinity was higher than normal. This could be because the Alaskan stream is not well represented in climatology.
Since the float is in Pacific (profile ~55) it's agreement with climatology is better.
But there seems to be a trend on top of it all.
