In the Gulf of Alaska	

Salinity have always been on the low side of mapped salinity
Wjo recommendation is to increase salinity by ~.0075 psu or ~1.00025

It sems to have drifted in a different salinity area (eddy? ) from profiles 50 to 128; and now back in a normal salinity area since

4900124 : 
IN the GOA
Clearly a drift in salinity (plot 3 shows systematic bias of uncal float salinity at latest profile)
Applied a piecewise linear fit except for profile 1 - 22)

4900501 : 
In the North Atlantic
Salinity started systematically low side but started to correct itself. Could be some biocide leaking in the cell when the float was deployed and slowly washed away.
Then, as probably there was no more biocide, fouling started to occurr because after profile 60, salinity decreased by lots, very abruptly and remains in the same range ever since, though it is hard to tell if the fouling is washing away. Could also be an eddy
I would fit piecewise linear correction factors from 1 to 55; then apply a constant 1.0007 after profile 60 or so.

4900503:
In the North Atlantic
Salinity consistently on the low side. As of late there seems to be a trend, but time will tell. In the meanwhile, safe thing to do is to 
correct the apparent offset by applying a 1.0002 correction factor

4900504:
North Atlantic
Has changed water masses on ~profile#90, but still shows "low side" salinity. Recently seems to show a trend but this could be 
because of change in water masses. Safe thing is to correct the apparent offset with factor of 1.0003

4900505:
NOrth Atlantic
No correction necessary according to Ron. Same verdict.

4900506:
North Atlantic
No correction necessary according to Ron. Same verdict.

4900507:
North Atlantic
Constant correction of .005

4900508:
GOA
ROn thought there was a constant offset. Looks like the float would have gone from overestimating salinity to underestimating it (slope). Difficult to imagine a unique mechanism 
responsible for such observation (biocide leaking, changing the configuration of conductivity cell, then fouling starting to occurr ?)
Differences are then probably attributable to complexity of region. No corrections.
Constant correction of .005

4900509:
GOA
Ron thought float didn't need correction, close to QCI eddies. 2 degC level shows that it's indeed not bad. Do not correct.

4900512:
Chile
Deep salinities good agreeement; climatology sparse.. do not correct

4900513:
Chile
Started to drift a profile 90. Apply correction slope from 80 to 116 and constant offset for the beginning

4900514:
GOA
Above and below climatology, seems normal

4900515:
GOA
Above and below climatology, seems normal

4900516:
Pacific
Systematic offset; apply constant factor .99984. No clear indication of drift.

4900519:
GOA/Pacific
Seems to show disagreement even at 1.8 theta; then again it goes up and down. Getting closer to coast.. Do not correct

4900520:
Pacific
Deep values agree; perceived difference is mainly around Theta=5 level. Do not correct

4900521:
GOA
Deep values seem to agree; but there is a drift at all depths, including theta=2. Correct with plateau (35 - 67) + slopes.

4900522:
GOA
Appears stable. Started out with constant offset, but now somehow "fixing" itself. Better not correct.

4900531:
North Atlantic
Drifted in a zone not so well described by climatology (prof 90 to 130) ; but now is correct. Could be a slight drift in sensor towards higher values, but time will tell. Theta=3 is fine.

4900537:
North Atlantic
Since cycle 90, salinity is lower than reference. However it is the reference which increased suddenly. This could be our float moving suddenly in a region usually historically characterized by high salinity but at the present time presenting different characteristics. If it was a conductivity drift we would probably see salinity values at 3.2 go down.. what is the likelihood that they suddenly start to go down at the very same time the float enters a higher salinity water mass? No corrections.

4900538:
North Atlantic
Impossible to "correct". Just wrong. 

4900627:
North Atlantic
Correction is systematic; however the fluctuations should on average be zero; applying .9996 like Ron did would not be a good idea. Theta=3.6 shows a good agreement. Do not correct.

4900628:
North Atlantic
Fluctuations up and down; centered around 1. Good agreement

4900629:
GOA
Fluctuations up and down; centered around 1. Theta=2 seems to show overall drift in conductivity which would have begun with higher than normal conductivity and now heading towards lower conductivity. Wait for more profiles before correcting.

4900630:
GOA
Fluctuations centered around 1. However there seems to be a very slow drift at 2.0 and 1.8. Wait and see.

4900631:
Pacific
Conductivity alone seems stable, but the climatology implies that salinity is too high (at theta=2 degC) since profile 50. I think that the float has drifted in a region whose characteristics are different than climatology. No correction.

4900632:
Pacific
At least an offset and probably still drifting. Stable climatology. Better to correct the float with piecewise. Ron did it.

4900633:
GOA
Seems like float started to foul and now is saturated. Do piecewise.

4900634
GOA
Ron assumed problem with climatology for cycles 1-55. However there seems to be a drift since, visible at theta=2. Started at profile 75 or so. Do correction.

4900635
North Atlantic
Reasonable agreement.

4900636
GOA
Small but constant offset. Do correct. Evidence for trend not sufficient yet.

4900637
Goa
strong drift. Accentuated since 75. Do correct piecewise linear.

4900676
North Atlantic
Good agreement . DO not correct.

4900677
North Atlantic
Negative offset, systematic. But good agreement at theta=3.4. Apply constant factor (very low)

4900678
North Atlantic
Good agreement . DO not correct.

4900679
North Atlantic
Good agreement . DO not correct.

4900680
North Atlantic
Deviations from climatology are symmetrical; salinity seems more stable than climatology. Do not correct

4900681
North Atlantic
Theta =3 and Theta=3.4 appear more stable than climatology. Many jumps in the beginning. Overall coefficient would decrease then increase. Looks more like normal variability to me.

4900682
North Atlantic
Systematic offset; apply small coefficient to all.

4900683
North Atlantic
Sensor seems more stable than climatology, at 3.4. Overall stable. Do not correct.

4900683
North Atlantic
Sensor seems more stable than climatology, at 3.4. Overall stable. Do not correct.

4900733
Pacific 
Rather stable

4900734
Pacific
Quite good; though lately since #65, salinity has been on the high side at 2 deg C. Keep watching.

4900735
GOA
theta=1.8 is very stable. do not correct

4900736
GOA
Very big offset, but variation seem to make it less apparent. Correct with a fixed offset for all.

4900737
Pacific
Very big offset similar to 4900736, Correct with a slope.

4900738
Pacific
Very big offset similar to 4900736, Correct with a slope.

4900739
Pacific
Very big offset similar to 4900736, Correct with a slope.

4900740
Pacific
Very big offset similar to 4900736, Correct with a slope.

4900741
Pacific
Very big offset similar to 4900736, Correct with a slope.

4900742
Pacific
Very big offset similar to 4900736, Correct with a slope.

4900866
Goa
Theta=2 seems to show a slow drift towards low salinity; 3.4 shows a lot of variability. Correct from profile 50 to today to compensate for the drift at theta=2; but then the "positive" error today is still smaller than the "negative" error used to be in the beginning. So don,t correct anything.

4900867
Goa
Started with high salinities but now is cacthing up to "normal". Probably good since the start. Do not correct

4900868
Goa
theta=1.8 level is most often than not below climatology. Correct recent slope which is >+.0001 above climatology

4900869
GOA
theta=1.8 was on the low side of climatology and since the float drifted closer to coast, it is slightly below (climatology is more tight there). Better correct with constant (.005)

4900870
GOA
Theta=2.4 shows a lot of variability (higher/lower) but do not adjust.

4900871
GOA
Salinity could be drifting.. but it is consistent. It is the climatology salinity which is increasing recently. DO not correct. Keep an eye for next time because there COULD be a drift.

4900872
GOA
theta=1.8 shows good agreement. Do not correct.

4900873
Pacific
theta=2 shows good agreement. do not correct

4900874
Pacific
theta=2 shows good agreement. do not correct

4900875
North atlantic
constant offset seems needed but deeper levels don't always say so (3, 3.4theta). apply minimal correctino factor.

4900876
North atlantic
seems ok but just like 4900875

4900877
North atlantic
small offset; no correction

4900878
north atlantic
systematic
salinity at thera=3.4 level is too low. Do Correct.

4900879
north atlantic
systematic offset but variability is quite big at 3=theta. Do not correct.

4900881
north atlantic
systematic offset and always smaller than climatology even at 3.4theta. Give constant offset

4900882
north atlantic
systematic offset and increasing, but theta=3.6 agrees with climatology. do nothing but keep an eye.

4900883
north atlantic; salinity is on the low side with new trend. Adjust piecewise.

4900884
systematic offset 

4901064:4901065

very little data yet but seem fine

4901066
goa
offset at theta=3 ; 2.2 does not always agree. Correct a little.

4901067
west pacific
lots of variability by 2.8 shows good agreement
